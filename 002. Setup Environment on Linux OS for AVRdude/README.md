> ## OS: Linux

On Linux platform everything is pretty much straightforward. Moreover, we will have full control over everything!
I'll mainly use a Ubuntu platform.

> #### Setup environment:

For Debian based distribution (like Debian or Ubuntu or Mint etc.) open the terminal and type the following commands in one line:

<code>sudo apt-get install avrdude avrdude-doc binutils-avr avr-libc gcc-avr gdb-avr</code>

For Red Hat and Fedora, replace <code>apt-get</code> with <code>yum</code> command to install the above packages and libraries.

> #### AVRdude

>> Important! Open a terminal and double-check your installation by typing <code>avrdude</code>.

If you see [this output](https://gist.github.com/piLinux/5ac684dae908abd13f4a), then everything should work perfectly.
